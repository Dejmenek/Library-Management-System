## Usage

## ER Model
🖋️ **Entity-Relationship Model**: The ER model visualizes entities, their attributes, and relationships between them. The ER diagram is available in the [ER Model](./docs/LibraryER.png) file.

## Relational Model
🔗 **Relational Model**: The relational model maps the ER model to a tabular representation, showing tables, keys, and relationships. The relational model diagram is available in the [Relational Model](./docs/LibraryRelational.png) file.
